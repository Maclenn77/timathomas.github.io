# how to setup a jekyll theme
I like the theme [grayscale](https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/grayscale-theme). I'm watching this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bty7LHm14CA) to see how to do it. 

1. go to the [grayscale theme in gihub](https://github.com/jeromelachaud/grayscale-theme) and fork it. 
2. delete the gh-pages branch
