								<p>I am currently an assistant professor researcher at U.C. Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies, research director for U.C. Berkeley’s  <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org" target="_blank">Urban Displacement Project</a>, and training lead for the NIH-funded Computational Social Science Training Program at the Berkeley Institute of Data Science. I am also the director of the  <a href="https://evictionresearch.net" target="_blank">Eviction Research Network</a>, a multi-University collaboration enumerating racial and gender disparities in eviction by collecting and mining court and sheriff records.
								</p>
								<p>
								I am an urban sociologist, demographer, and data scientist researching the social, political, and economic drivers of racial, gender, and socio-economic stratification in housing and migration. My research program is centered around developing new tools to measure gentrification, displacement, and eviction. From 2017 to 2019 I was a postdoc at the University of Washington’s eScience Institute where I linked and analyzed HMIS and housing authority data. In 2019, I started the Evictions Study (now the Eviction Research Network) where my team and I used natural language processing to mine addresses from court records and estimate demographics, which provided empirical evidence for Washington State and Baltimore City to help pass several tenant protection laws. In 2020, I led a team at the Urban Displacement Project to map gentrification and displacement in several U.S. cities and also developed the  <a href="https://www.urbandisplacement.org/maps/housing-precarity-risk-model/" target="_blank">Housing Precarity Risk Model</a> (HPRM) to predict where households vulnerable to displacement and eviction were located due to the pandemic. This work helped to identify vulnerability within their cities, motivated the CDC’s eviction moratorium extension, and led to an invitation where I currently advise the White House’s Executive Office of the President, HUD, and the Treasury Department on eviction trends and rental assistance program. Other projects include writing reports on the effects of eviction on health and families by invitation from the National Academy of Sciences and developing machine learning prediction models on displacement risk using household level data. I am also leading a national eviction data collection to advance research on this topic by creating a panel dataset linked to administrative, health, and other individual level data. Finally, I provide training and mentorship at U.C. Berkeley in research and data science for graduate and undergraduate students.
								<!-- My interdisciplinary research involves both scholarly and policy-relevant work. My dissertation, “Forced Out: Race, Market, and Neighborhood Dynamics of Evictions,” identifies racial and gender disparities in eviction filings in King County, WA in 2013 along with associated neighborhood segregation, housing market, and rent burden trends for an otherwise unknown population. Using a Bayesian model to estimate the race and gender of evicted households, I find that black adults are overrepresented in eviction filings six times more than whites, with black female adults facing eviction filing rates seven times higher than white female adults. Neighborhood spatial analysis finds that the most affordable, gentrifying, and racially diverse neighborhoods have the highest likelihood of an eviction filing in King County, WA. Since my dissertation defense in 2017, this study helped settle a disparate impact case prosecuted by the ACLU and the Northwest Justice Project and laid the groundwork for an extended study and public report for the Puget Sound Region titled “<a href="https://evictions.study/washington/" target="_blank">The State of Evictions</a>.” This extended study utilizes machine learning and natural language processing to pull defendant addresses and reasons for eviction from several million pages of eviction court filings over 14 years. In collaboration with state politicians, attorneys, and advocates, “The State of Evictions” report helped pass a new Washington State law that extends the eviction pay or vacate period from three days to fourteen days. My 12-member evictions research team and I are expanding this work to other under-studied areas including Baltimore, Connecticut, Indianapolis, and Chicago. --></p>
<!-- 								<p>My research agenda is marked by an intellectual foundation in policy-relevant research operationalized through collaborations and student mentorship that addresses real-world problems and advances scholarly research. The collaborative component involves fostering government and practitioner relationships to identify relevant research questions and gain access to unique datasets. I have worked closely with state and local lawmakers, housing practitioners, non-profits, legal aid attorneys, police, and city officials on the topics of displacement, homelessness, hate crimes, gentrification, and segregation. As part of my ongoing commitment to training future researchers, I make a point to work alongside students on these projects, providing them with unique training in data science and sociological theory and individually focused mentorship while improving my program management skills.</p> -->
								<p>My research and teaching interests include urban sociology, race & ethnicity, neighborhood change, residential segregation, housing & poverty, residential mobility, social organization, data dcience, statistics, and spatial demography.</p>
